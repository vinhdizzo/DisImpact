## Background on Multi-Ethnicity Categorization

When it comes to disaggregating student outcomes by ethnicity, one typically relies on a single ethnicity categorization that assigns each student to a single race/ethnicity category.  However, it is not uncommon for students to identify as a member of more than one ethnicity group.  Categorization of ethnicity is typically simplified by assigning these multi-ethnicity students to a "more than 2 races" group or assigning students to a single race/ethnicity category using a pre-defined rule set.  For example, in the case of IPEDS ethnicity, if a student identifies as Hispanic or Latino, then that student would be grouped into the "Hispanic / Latino" ethnicity group regardless of however many additional race/ethnicity boxes are checked.

Conducting a disproportionate impact (DI) analysis using a single ethnicity categorization has the potential to skew results when some students are left out (the impact can be large depending on the institution and/or the size of these groups), and could also mask some student groups that appear hidden under a single categorization formula.  A more inclusive approach to DI analysis would be to include students in all ethnicity groups that they identify with.  For example, if a studenty identifies as Hispanic and White, then they should be included in both the Hispanic group and the White group.  Similarly, if a student identifies as Black and Asian, then they should be included in both the Black group and the Asian group.

Carrying out the previous analysis is certainly feasible, but suffers from practical implementation for at least two reasons:

1. The distribution of the ethnicity group components do not add up to 100%, leading to a potentially distorted view and confusion among the audience.
2. Working with more granular ethnicity data from multiple variables increases the complexity of the analysis considerably, reducing the likelihood that a multi-ethnicity view is adopted in most DI analysis.

In this vignette, we illustrate how the `DisImpact` package could be adapted to carry out a multi-ethnicity analysis using the `di_iterate` function as the workhorse, and manipulating the returned summary data set.

## Multi-Ethnicity Data Format

In the case of single ethnicity categorization, ethnicity is usually stored in a single variable or column that lists the ethnicity group for each student (row).  In the case of multi-ethnicity data, when a student could correspond to multiple groups, there are multiple ways to describe such information.  Here, we describe three common approaches:

1. A *single variable/column* that lists all student groups that a student (row) corresponds to in a single data cell, usually delimited by a comma or some other delimeter.  For example, the value in the data cell could have the value `Asian, Black, Hispanic` if the students fall into these three groups.
2. A *wide format* format consisting of the same number of flags as there are groups, where each flag is binary (1/0), indicating group membership in each column.  For example, if there are 9 groups, then there would be 9 additional variables/columns with names such as `Flag_Group_1`, ..., `Flag_Group_9`, where each variable will take on a value of 1 or 0, with 1 indicating group membership, and 0 indicating non-membership.
3. A *long format* that has each student corresponding to the same number of rows as the number of groups they are members of, with an ethnicity column similar to that of a single ethnicity categorization.  For example, if a student self-identifies as Asian, Black, and Hispanic, then the student would have three rows in the data set, with an ethnicity column having the following three values in the three corresponding rows: `Asian`, `Black`, `Hispanic`.

The second, wide format is preferred when it comes to conducting a DI analysis using the `DisImpact` package.  The included `student_equity` data set consists of ethnicity flags, and these variables will be used in a multi-ethnicity DI analysis.

## Multi-Ethnicity Example Data Set

As seen in the Scaling DI [vignette](./Scaling-DI-Calculations.html), one could repeat DI calculations over various success variables, group (disaggregation) variables, and cohort variables using `di_iterate`.  The following snippet illustrates this capability using default parameters:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load some necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(forcats)
library(DisImpact)

# Load student equity data set
data(student_equity)

# Caclulate DI over several scenarios
df_di_summary <- di_iterate(data=student_equity
                          , success_vars=c('Math', 'English', 'Transfer')
                          , group_vars=c('Ethnicity', 'Gender')
                          , cohort_vars=c('Cohort_Math', 'Cohort_English', 'Cohort')
                          , scenario_repeat_by_vars=c('Ed_Goal', 'College_Status')
                            )
```

In addition to the `Ethnicity` variable, the `student_equity` data set also contains ethnicity flags that are more granular, based on what students report.  A student could be assigned to more than one category.  For example, a student could fall into the Asian and South East Asian categories.  Similarly, a student could fall into both White and SWANA categories.

```{r}
head(student_equity)
## # Correlation to show overlap
## cor(student_equity[, str_detect(names(student_equity), 'EthnicityFlag')])
```

## Analysis of Multi-Ethnicity Data Using DisImpact

For a multi-ethnicity analysis, one could pass a list of ethnicity flags to the `group` parameter of `di_iterate`, similar to how `Gender` and `Ethnicity` were passed in the previous example to create `df_di_summary`.  However, since the flags are binary (1's and 0's), and the ethnicity group names are in the variable names themselves (eg, `EthnicityFlag_Asian`), the user needs to filter on the appropriate rows corresponding to the groups of interest (1 value in the flags), extract the group names, and store the group names in the `group` column of the returned summary data set.  The following code illustrates this with the `student_equity` data set.

```{r}
# Identify the ethnicity flag variables
want_vars <- names(student_equity)[str_detect(names(student_equity), '^EthnicityFlag')]
want_vars <- want_vars[!str_detect(want_vars, 'Unknown')] # Remove nknownU
want_vars <- want_vars[!str_detect(want_vars, 'Two')] # Remove Two or More Races
want_vars # Ethnicity Flags of interest

# Convert the ethnicity flags to character as required by di_iterate
for (varname in want_vars) {
  student_equity[[varname]] <- as.character(student_equity[[varname]])
}

# DI analysis
df_di_summary_mult_eth <- di_iterate(data=student_equity
                          , success_vars=c('Math', 'English', 'Transfer')
                          , group_vars=want_vars # specify the list of ethnicity flag variables
                          , cohort_vars=c('Cohort_Math', 'Cohort_English', 'Cohort')
                          , scenario_repeat_by_vars=c('Ed_Goal', 'College_Status')
                            ) %>%
  filter(group=='1') %>% # Ethnicity flags have 1's and 0's; filter on just the 1 group as that is of interest
  # filter((group=='1') | (disaggregation=='- None' & group=='- All')) %>% 
  mutate(group=str_replace(disaggregation, 'EthnicityFlag_', '') %>% gsub(pattern='([A-Z])', replacement=' \\1', x=.) %>% str_replace('^ ', '') # Rather than show '1', identify the ethnicity group names and assign them to group
       , disaggregation='Multi-Ethnicity' # Originally is a list of variable names corresponding to the various ethnicity flags; call this disaggregation 'Multi-Ethnicity'
         )

# Check if re-assignments are correct
table(df_di_summary_mult_eth$disaggregation, useNA='ifany')
table(df_di_summary_mult_eth$group, useNA='ifany')

# Illustration: the group proportions add up to more than 100% since a student could be counted in more than 1 group
df_di_summary_mult_eth %>%
  filter(Ed_Goal=='- All', College_Status=='- All', success_variable=='Transfer', cohort=='2018') %>%
  select(group, n) %>%
  mutate(Proportion=n / sum(student_equity$Cohort=='2018')) %>%
  mutate(Sum_Proportion=sum(Proportion))
```

## Visualizing in Dashboard Platform

Once a DI summary data set for multi-ethnicity is available, it could be combined with other summary data sets to be used in dashboard development as described in the Scaling DI [vignette](./Scaling-DI-Calculations.html).

```{r}
# Combine
df_di_summary_combined <- bind_rows(
  df_di_summary
  , df_di_summary_mult_eth # Could first filter on rows of interest (eg, just the categorizations of interest to the institution)
)

# Disaggregation: Ethnicity
df_di_summary_combined %>%
  filter(Ed_Goal=='- All', College_Status=='- All', success_variable=='Math', disaggregation=='Ethnicity') %>%
  select(cohort, group, n, pct, di_indicator_ppg, di_indicator_prop_index, di_indicator_80_index) %>%
  as.data.frame

# Disaggregation: Multi-Ethnicity
df_di_summary_combined %>%
  filter(Ed_Goal=='- All', College_Status=='- All', success_variable=='Math', disaggregation=='Multi-Ethnicity') %>%
  select(cohort, group, n, pct, di_indicator_ppg, di_indicator_prop_index, di_indicator_80_index) %>%
  as.data.frame
```
```{r include=FALSE}
# run_plots <- FALSE
run_plots <- TRUE
if (run_plots) {
  # Disaggregation: Ethnicity
  df_di_summary_combined %>%
    filter(Ed_Goal=='- All', College_Status=='- All', success_variable=='Math', disaggregation=='Ethnicity') %>%
    select(cohort, group, n, pct, di_indicator_ppg, di_indicator_prop_index, di_indicator_80_index) %>%
    mutate(group=factor(group) %>% fct_reorder(desc(pct))) %>%
