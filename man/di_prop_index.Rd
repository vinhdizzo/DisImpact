\title{Calculate Disproportionate Impact per the Proportionality Index (PI) method.}
\usage{
di_prop_index(success, group, cohort, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{success}{A vector of success indicators (\code{1}/\code{0} or \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}) or an unquoted reference (name) to a column in \code{data} if it is specified.}

\item{group}{A vector of group names of the same length as \code{success} or an unquoted reference (name) to a column in \code{data} if it is specified.}

\item{cohort}{(Optional) A vector of cohort names of the same length as \code{success} or an unquoted reference (name) to a column in \code{data} if it specified.  Disproportionate Impact is calculated for every group within each cohort.  When \code{cohort} is not specified, then the analysis assumes a single cohort.}

\item{data}{(Optional) A data frame containing the variables of interest.  If \code{data} is specified, then \code{success}, \code{group}, and \code{cohort} will be searched within it.}
}
\value{
A data frame consisting of: cohort (if used), group, n (sample size), success (number of successes for the cohort-group), pct_success (proportion of successes attributed to the group within the cohort), pct_group (proportion of sample attributed to the group within the cohort), and di_prop_index (ratio of pct_success to pct_group).  When di_prop_index < 1, then there are signs of Disproportionate Impact.

Calculate Disproportionate Impact per the Proportionality Index (PI) method.
}
\details{
This function determines Disproportionate Impact based on the Proportionality Index (PI) method, as described in \href{http://extranet.cccco.edu/Portals/1/TRIS/Research/Accountability/GUIDELINES\%20FOR\%20MEASURING\%20DISPROPORTIONATE\%20IMPACT\%20IN\%20EQUITY\%20PLANS.pdf}{this} reference from the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office.  It assumes that a higher rate is good ("success").  For rates that are deemed negative (eg, rate of drop-outs, high is bad), then consider looking at the converse of the non-success (eg, non drop-outs, high is good) instead in order to leverage this function properly.
